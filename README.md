# EDAFilm
Exploratory data analysis ([EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)) on film data.

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2022**

## Why
I wanted to do an EDA using Python + Jupyter + VSCode (_EDAFilm.ipynb_) and compare the experience with my go-to environment: R + RStudio. I took inspiration from this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-q24gS8cqg) which uses this [Netflix data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). I also made a version using VSCode's Python Interactive mode (_EDAFilm.py_).
